# This is the directory that your KDE sources are downloaded to.  This
# directory also holds the build and log directories by default.

# This is the directory that KDE will end up installed at.  The default is
# appropriate for a single-user installation of KDE, which requires no root
# permissions.  If you'd like, you can install and use the sudo program to
# install KDE anywhere on your system, in conjunction with the
# make-install-prefix option.
  kdedir /usr/local

# This is the Qt installation to use for building/using KDE. The default is
# to build Qt (see the qt module below). If you wish to use your system's
# installed Qt (assuming it is recent enough!) then you can set this to the
# path to your Qt installation. To find the path to your system's Qt, run
# "qmake -v". Qt will be installed to the path reported (do not include /lib)
  qtdir /usr

# By default (if the above is commented out), you are getting svn trunk / git master.
# If instead you want to check out another branch, like 4.7, use
#	branch KDE/4.7
#
# With KDE/4.7, use "branch 2.6" for soprano, or distribution-provided soprano.

# but also see the qt and kdesupport modules below, which have special
# requirements

# This is the Subversion server to download the rest of the KDE sources from.

# cmake-options controls the compilation options for building KDE 4 modules.
# These options apply to all KDE modules unless otherwise specified.

# should experiment with setting this value higher for best performance.

# KDE has one of the most extensive translation packages in the world.  They
# are stored in the l10n module.  kdesrc-build can automatically try to build
# and install languages for you, using this parameter.  It should be a list
# of languages to build and install.  This option requires the language code
# as present in l10n.  You can look these codes up at
# http://i18n.kde.org/teams/
#	kde-languages de        # German
#	kde-languages fr        # French
#	kde-languages en_GB cs  # British English and Czech

# If you would like install KDE to the system (DO NOT INSTALL *over* a prior
# installation!), then you'll probably need to use sudo to install everything.
#
# The -S parameter causes sudo to read from standard input (which is redirected
# by kdesrc-build).  This means that if sudo has to ask for your password, it
# will fail, you need to configure sudo to be able to run "make install"
# without requesting a password.
#
# In addition, you can run kdesrc-build --no-install, and then
# sudo kdesrc-build --install if you are unable to configure sudo to allow
# make install with no password.

# purge-old-logs controls whether old log files should be removed after the
# latest build finishes. Set to false to disable it.
